That’s very important (because I’m pretty sure most of the events either don’t actually exist or they are put together very poorly). 
Second, my story and experience with fever is much the same as those who have given a similar rating. I bought tickets for two events MONTHS in advance. The week before the first one (the candlelight concert) I noticed that the dates on our tickets had changed to a later date. When I tried the “chat live” option, I got a message saying they were busy and then another saying to email my email to them so they could get back to me later. I asked for either the date on our tickets to be changed back to when we had originally booked or for a refund. When someone eventually got back to me, I was told they had to unexpectedly “postpone” the event. I asked for a refund of the tickets for that event as well as the Van Gogh event. I was told I would be receiving a refund and I’m waiting patiently for that to occur. 
Please look this app up on the Better Business Bureau, those reports say a lot of the same things. This app is a scam and I have no idea how it has such a high rating. It’s the Fyre festival all over again.",US

We had a death in the family and wanted to reschedule our tickets to an event that evening and Israel the live chat agent was very rude to me after I explained the situation. We weren’t asking for a refund, just a reschedule. I asked to speak with a supervisor or manager and he said that was not possible. He said “I’m not going to bend rules for you or anyone else. If you had contacted us 24 hours in advance we may have been able to help you. No company in world would give you refund the same day.” And then he disconnected the chat before I could respond.

When I viewed my most recent purchase it said there was only one ticket. I was pretty upset because it was a purchase for my son the next day and I was worried that there would not be tickets left this late. I was confident that I had made a purchase of three but I continued to refresh the app and it continued to display only one. I even showed it to my  I then purchased two additional tickets so our family could attend the planned event. Minutes later I returned to the app and it now stated 3 tickets on the original purchase and 2 on the second purchase. I reached out to the customer service line which responded that they do not issue refunds. To me this is a no brainer in customer service. If a customer is telling you the app you developed and regulate had an error which resulted in additional purchases the company should issue a refund. In addition this also to me seems like fraud. If I tell the user they only have one ticket they'll buy more and that increases my sales. Overall I'm not returning to this app, if this is how they operate fraudulently.

Also, on the Van Gogh exhibit *website* (not the app), choosing a date and time is easy (one can clearly see which dates & times still have availability). On the app, however, to find out if there is still availability, one has to scroll through the dates, then scroll through the times, and then scroll through the different ways to pay.

Suffice to say, the experience was terrible across the board - bad and insufficient food, absurdly overpriced, lackluster table service, and additional price gouging at every opportunity. Worst of all, they made a mockery of the tradition - Dark Dining experiences are a very special tradition in the blind community, and Fever cut every possible corner in staging this sham, in a way that would’ve been impossible to know before paying up front.

Of course I reached out to them in an attempt to rectify afterwards: wrote a review, responded to an automated customer service reach out, and even proactively wrote customer experience again weeks after the event.
What did I get for all my troubles? A response that seemed like a joke - many un-returned emails later, a rep basically pretended to “thank” me for my review and ended with a smiley face, not once even acknowledging or remotely apologizing for the terrible experience, or seeking to rectify the situation.

Not wanting to be inundated with marketing emails, I downloaded the App using a “hidden” Apple email address.  It first asks you to “choose a city.”  When I begin typing “San Antonio,” it immediately tells me my city isn’t listed.  It’s listed alright…it just makes you go through all the cities to find the one you’re looking for!

Since I didn’t sign up using the same email address I used to purchase the tickets, the app can’t “connect” to my previous purchase. There doesn’t seem to be a way to enter my confirmation number as an alternative.

When I finally break down and try to update my email address…only to now get a message saying “ERROR SETTING THE USER DATA.”

I had AmEx file a fraud complaint on my behalf. AmEx refunded me PROMPTLY b/c they also found a bunch of shady things.
Not satisfied, I then sent their CMO, CEO and VP if CS in-mails and emails. NO REPLY.
I noticed a former employee of my Large Tech Company now worker there and sent HIM a ""strongly worded email"". The response was rude and also shady.

I actually work in live events and that’s not really a thing at the moment) anyways, I’m told that I have been issued vouchers for three free identical tickets at a later date. However when I went to get tickets for the new date with the vouchers they supplied my account Fever wanted to charge me an addition $16. That’s weird but whatever, I get on the live chat for assistance. The guy on there tells me I have received full credit and there’s nothing he can do. I tell him it’s not a full credit by definition if I’m being charged. He says that prices have changed and tough luck, I was given all of my money back in full as fiver credit. But that’s not a full ticket credit—that’s taking my $112 US dollars and exchanging it into 112 “Fever bucks”. Hardly an equal value. First they cancelled my tickets and then want to charge me more money to reschedule. I was even exchanging a Sunday for a Sunday. It feels like a scam, so I asked for a regular refund and then was told that tickets purchased on Fever are non-refundable and non-exchangeable and that someone might contact me about it later. Well, I just got the response email they said to look out for: an automatically generated email that said they won’t refund me at all, it’s not their policy. Am I being petty over the difference of $16? Perhaps. I just want to see dinosaurs with my family for the same price that was literally bought and paid for months ago. I’m not certain but this feels borderline illegal and at this point it’s more of a principle thing.

A couple of months ago I purchased two tickets through the app for the Van Gogh Immersive Experience at the Tower Theater in Philadelphia.  The tickets were for 11:30 a.m. on Monday, Oct. 4th.  I took off work and we drove two hours to the theater only to be turned away because, starting that day, the theater was requiring proof of vaccination and/or a recent COVID test.  We spent another couple of hours looking for a pharmacy which would do a rapid test since one of us didn't have a copy of their card along.  At 1:00 p.m.we both received an email message from Fever informing us of the new requirement.  I reached out to Fever to get a refund on the tickets the next day.  First I was told I couldn't because I transferred both tickets I purchased to my friend.  Not true, I only transferred one but paid for both on my credit card.  Then I was told Fever doesn't issue refunds, but I would only be given a voucher towards another date and time for this event or another event.  They failed to inform us of this change in policy prior to the date and time of our tickets. This wasn't a random last minute policy change by the theater.  It was due to a recent requirement by the City of Philadelphia.  Had we lived in the Phila. area we may have been aware of it.

AND WATCH OUT FOR SANTIAGO ACOSTA. The purchase on the app/desktop. The confirmation. The confirmation email. SAVE any email correspondence. 

 Worst experience with customer service ever! I work in events and hospitality and man, Fever idk where you guys got trained. This is where rude Santiago Acosta might come in. 

 It started when I received an email that the event I paid for was being rescheduled due to equipment issues. The email stated I could “simply” select another date for said event. YEAH. RIGHT. Their app wouldn’t allow me to do so, desktop version didn’t even have a record of my purchase?, customer service didn’t offer to idk? Reschedule for me if possible? That would’ve avoided a lot of this mess. I submitted screen shots of their app to the customer service rep to prove I couldn’t “simply” reschedule, where they kept replying with directions that, like I said before, couldn’t preform because their app wouldn’t let me. After a few times of throwing these directions back and forth, the rep quickly switched to getting rid of me however possible and responded with they “already issued a refund” and I would receive my money back 10 days later. Luckily that actually happened. Life can be unpredictable, and I honestly wouldn’t trust Fever with an event (going nor hosting! Yikes!) after this experience. The events they offer can simply be found through THAT event’s IG/Website or Event Brite. Probably cheaper too. No stars.",US

I bought 2 tickets to the candlelight dinner with a classical artist at Yamashiro for $130. The reservation included a free wine/beer, premium appetizer, and of course, watching the artist. This did not include entrees. I normally would not spend so much BUT I figured, my boyfriend & I would enjoy being sat in the beautiful garden while enjoying peaceful classical live music. I got an email less than 24 hrs before saying that because there were only 2 of us in my party, we were going to be moved to an outside patio and have a direct view to a TV (A TV!!!!) which would display the artist. Why would I pay $130 for a patio and tv experience... again, not including actual dinner. I was upset because I felt the description was extremely deceptive. I immediately tried getting in contact with them. I was put on hold for an hour and even then, I was not able to get in contact with a single representative. I emailed multiple times and they claimed that they were “experiencing high volumes of emails”— I would only get automated responses. Finally, I was able to get in contact with someone via the chat through the app. I expressed my concerns and “Nestor” told me that he would send my request up to a different department because they didn’t handle cases like mine. So he told me that they would be in contact with me through email shortly. I asked if I could speak with the department directly and he told me that the department did not have a phone number. What department doesn’t have a phone...?!?!?  I still have not received any email and my reservation was on 8/18. They have a no refund policy, but I disputed the charge through my bank.

I fell prey to the confusing advertising and misleading nature of Fever's sales tactics to sell tickets for ""Van Gogh: The Immersive Experience."" I had intended to buy tickets for ""Immersive Van Gogh"" and due to the confusing nature of these two events and Fever's heavy advertising (putting it on sale the same day as the other event! both taking place this summer in New York and both at unnamed locations and both with essentially the same name!) - I unwittingly purchased two adult tickets and one child ticket thinking it was for the other event. The ""Immersive Van Gogh"" exhibit had been depicted on a television show and that was the one I thought I was buying tickets for. How could there possibly be two?! I thought. When I contacted Fever asking for a refund because I was essentially duped into buying tickets for the wrong event, I was told no refunds allowed. (Due to their confusing app, I also accidentally purchased 3 children's tickets -- they did refund that.)

But they refused to return my money for the two adults/one child tickets. I have submitted these transactions as disputes on PayPal, but Fever says it’s keeping my money. I do not even feel comfortable trying to sell my tickets to someone else to try to recoup my costs. From media descriptions, it appears that Fever's ""Van Gogh: The Immersive Experience"" is far inferior to the other event.

Arriving early at the event, I was told by Hornblower staff, the ship it was supposed to be on, that there was no such event or cruise ship leaving from the pier for it. I noticed other people trying to attend the event, with just as much confusion on their faces when they realized there was no boat prepared. 

I contacted Fever that day, asking what happened, why I never received an event cancellation email and for a refund. I was only told, “We’ll message our other department and investigate why this happened.” I called again three days later, still the same reply. I called a week later from the event, and after chatting with them about an obviously fake event, I’m told my request for a refund would take 10+ days. What refund takes 10+ days?! Why would it also take so long for them to investigate their own event? I ask for an email confirmation of the refund statement and am told it will come in five minutes. It never came. I call again an hour later, only to be told the same information, and when I ask for the name of the person I’m speaking with, I’m given an obviously fake name. 

This has been a hugely upsetting experience. I’ve never dealt with a fake event app, and I’m sorry I ever used this app. I wasted a $100 on a seemingly legit app. Please don’t make the same mistakes I did.

I agree with the previous customer review. Cool concept and some good events, a few that I attended. However customer service is a sham.

As it says there are no refunds EVEN when they advertise a false event!

Seven days ago I bought tickets for $72 event. When I got there, there was No event. The venue was CLOSED. I double checked the time on the tickets which was correct. I called the venue which didn't pick up because they were closed. Try to call them, didn't work, and no email. So I used their chat system, in which the person vaguely said they look into it. Two days later when their charge cleared I asked again when they would take care of it and was met with a  rude response, saying the matter takes time.  

7 day later no change in my bank account, no outreach, even sent a chat message today which was ignored. 

Use at your own risk.... or better yet call the venue before purchasing to avoid being charged for a fake event.",US

There should be an option to use the credits first. It'd be nice to have a somewhat reasonable way to assuage my suspicions of this being a scam.

I got a visa gift card to put in and yeah this app is pretty great. I've been to some nice spots the past week. Wish they had more variety though. Seems most parties and event are for snooty folk. It's be nice if they had more in the other boroughs.",US

Though, it’s very misleadingly, it says they will process the request even though they don’t honor it? This makes no sense. You either need to say you do or don’t offer a refund, not both. Their customer service needs to be rechecked and their wording needs to be honored. I feel as a customer, I have been very misled and scammed.

Afterwards, I received the confirmation email with the Ticket ID number listed, along with instructions on how to get the tickets, with a link provided that re-directs you to the Eventbrite site. The instructions further states, there’s a promo code to use on Eventbrite. You need to select the same tickets you purchased from Fever, and the total should be $0 during the purchase process on Eventbrite. This is not the case. 

I’ve emailed Fever 3 times. They sent the same confirmation email I received after purchasing the tickets stating the Promo Code and Ticket ID  number is listed. You can’t download the tickets from the Fever App. It has the same instructions on listed on it, like the email confirmation. 

Who’s sending the emails out?? I don’t know if the email is auto generated or what but clearly there wasn’t a Promo Code, just the Ticket ID number like before.  

I’m currently waiting to hear back from someone on the Fever team regarding the code, in order for me to get the $140 tickets I paid for. If this is what you have to go through for tickets through this company, don’t bother. Stay away. It’s not worth the time you will spend emailing back and forth just to get a Promo Code.",US

I first bought two tickets to go to a candlelight concert.

Unfortunately we couldn’t attend to the new date so I contacted fever up several times to get my tickets rescheduled as there was another event later on, after two weeks of trying to reach out to them, didn’t get an answer and lost the opportunity to attend the concert as they replied to me when there were no dates available anymore. When I asked for a refund they just gave me a voucher to use in another event.

After a while, I saw another event in which I wasn't too  interested but I had to use the voucher, right? So I went in and try to purchase two tickets with the voucher. I had so many errors in the app and they ended up charging me $135 in my bank card and only use a bit of the voucher!! SO FRUSTRATING 
Now they don’t want to refund me the $135. So they’re basically stealing from me. Terrible.

Upon arrival the staff didn't know where to direct us after receiving our tickets, we were eventually shown to a spare row of uncomfortable plastic chairs that protested with loud screeches at the slightest of movement. 

The performance dragged on for an uninspiring hour punctuated only by the extremely regular screeches of the cheap decor, the hacking sound of the ancient aircondition looming over the already low ceilings like some sort of evil spirit, and regular unsilenced phone calls and covid sounding dry coughs.

Because I did this, it’s created an email address from my Apple I.D that I can’t get emails through. I try to change my email address on my profile and it won’t allow me to. Now, when I book for the event, it tells me they’ve sent an email with all the info to my ‘email address’ which is the wrong one. Also, after signing up for the Titanic Waitlist on the website before getting the app, I got an email with a £5 off voucher. When I add it to the app, it is not recognised and can’t be used! There is absolutely nothing about a time limit for the voucher on the email. FIX THESE ISSUES PLEASE. Not a good first impression!! Update: the Fever customer service is some of the worst I have ever experienced. Although they do email back, in every single email it is very clear that they haven’t read my emails properly and so suggest things I have previously told them I’ve done.

The only downside of the app is that I feel that it is easily done to book the wrong date/time slot. When you go back to a previous page it resets the chosen date/time to the first available instead of the one that you had chosen. So you need to keep checking. I wish that it would say in every page what slot/date you were booking up until the confirmation of payment page. Just a heads up.",GB

Recently I received a email regarding cinema tickets from fever and believing it to be an offer disregarded it. The next day pay pal informed me Fever had taken a transaction from me. I looked on the app (which I hadn’t opened since November when i used it to purchase tickets for an event) to find a single ticket for cinema tickets for around the m25 (or something like that). I was completely dumbfounded. I immediately emailed Fever and their response has been shocking. They basically told me that they didn’t believe me and in any case i still had some time left on the ticket so all’s good! Incensed i then began to look at the purchase date on the ticket, it was before i even downloaded the app. When i went back to Fever they sent me a snotty email telling me that they had taken the usual move of refunding my money but that i should delete my payment method from the app. Why would i need to delete my payment method when as they say purchases aren’t completed without authorisation?! While i was incredibly angry i had got my money back and made sure to delete everything related to the app and asked for the complaints process so as to make sure this wouldn’t happen to someone else. The customer service ignored my email refusing to give me any complaints details. I reported the app and gave up. Since then i have been receiving emails on a regular basis from Fever something that i did not opt in for. I have asked to be taken off the mailing list especially considering I don’t even have the app anymore!!! And i have asked for my data to be erased. I guess we’ll see if they can manage that although if my experience with them is anything to go by i guess I’ll be ignored to have to report them again!",GB

It appeared to offer some pretty neat events in London that I wouldn't otherwise have knowledge of.  Spotted an event that I had to pay £10 per person for and turned up to find the venue closed with no signs of life. Yet the even is suggesting it's sold out. We then later discovered that the even was further down the street at a different event and was actually a PRIVATE PARTY! I will be complaining and I will be getting my money back for time and effort gone into travelling to the event in the first place! I hate to give it even 1 star but I actually don't have a choice. The app should be operated a lot better. Reminds me of groupons early days.

By way of an update: I was fortunate enough to purchase tickets through PayPal and have since opened a dispute. Today is the last day of the dispute and the seller or the owner of the app has not made any contact either directly or via PayPal to resolve the issue. This app is a fraud! And I will be awarded a refund following the dispute.

I have used many ticketing apps and this is the worse I have seen. I wanted to buy a ticket for my elderly mother and myself. The app doesn’t allow you to buy tickets for different prices at the same time. You are forced to buy them separately. Therefore I first bought my mother’s then when I went back to try and buy my ticket it said the event was sold out. My mother obviously did not want to go by herself so the ticket was wasted. It says on the app that if you want to buy tickets for children and adults you also have to but separately! Ridiculous. Also they took €29 out of my account when the ticket cost €15 and have refused a refund. Be careful and use another ticketing app if possible as I’ve never had such problems with any other ticketing app,ES

Tampoco estaría de más proponer más planes culturales, y típicos de cada ciudad. (Madrid no es sólo comida y terraceo, que también, sino teatros, visitas culturales, festivales para todas las edades, etc. )

Nous avions utilisé Fever pour une surprise d’anniversaire : faire un tour de quad dans Paris. Notre séance a été annulée, sans nous prévenir directement (uniquement par un mail quelques heures avant). Résultat : déplacement inutile, organisation dans nos planning pour rien et une amie déçue par la surprise ratée. 

Pour ce préjudice, ils ont juste reconnu que l’erreur venait de leur part et ont proposé un dédommagement ridicule.

Déçue, ils ne savent pas écouter leurs clients et c’est vraiment de l’attrape touristes. Aucun professionnalisme, Fever tu m’as plutôt donner mal à la tête que l’envie de faire la fête.",FR
