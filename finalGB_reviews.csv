I realised as it was happening and tried closing the app and refreshing as there was no cancel button, but frustratingly the booking went through. It was a Saturday, I tried every means of contacting them (email, phone etc) immediately after, explaining exactly what happened, to no avail. It took weeks of my persistent chasing (calling their phone which was never answered) before finally getting a response and then they refused to help or do anything about it. They wouldn’t even consider exchanging the money into credit to use on the app for other future event bookings. They were grossly unhelpful, unsympathetic and did nothing to resolve or compensate the situation which arose because they had an extremely insecure booking system. I will never use them again and would encourage others to steer clear of them - if anything goes wrong with your booking their customer service is appalling, they have no respect for their customers which is a shame as I had previously been a loyal customer and regularly made bookings through the app. But the second there was a mistake they couldn’t have cared less.",Hands down one of the worst companies I’ve ever dealt with,2019-10-04 18:03:20,1,BellaK22,GB

Now, when I book for the event, it tells me they’ve sent an email with all the info to my ‘email address’ which is the wrong one. Also, after signing up for the Titanic Waitlist on the website before getting the app, I got an email with a £5 off voucher. When I add it to the app, it is not recognised and can’t be used! There is absolutely nothing about a time limit for the voucher on the email. FIX THESE ISSUES PLEASE. Not a good first impression!!

The only downside of the app is that I feel that it is easily done to book the wrong date/time slot.

Recently I received a email regarding cinema tickets from fever and believing it to be an offer disregarded it. The next day pay pal informed me Fever had taken a transaction from me. I looked on the app (which I hadn’t opened since November when i used it to purchase tickets for an event) to find a single ticket for cinema tickets for around the m25 (or something like that). I was completely dumbfounded. I immediately emailed Fever and their response has been shocking. They basically told me that they didn’t believe me and in any case i still had some time left on the ticket so all’s good! Incensed i then began to look at the purchase date on the ticket, it was before i even downloaded the app. When i went back to Fever they sent me a snotty email telling me that they had taken the usual move of refunding my money but that i should delete my payment method from the app. Why would i need to delete my payment method when as they say purchases aren’t completed without authorisation?! While i was incredibly angry i had got my money back and made sure to delete everything related to the app and asked for the complaints process so as to make sure this wouldn’t happen to someone else. The customer service ignored my email refusing to give me any complaints details. I reported the app and gave up. Since then i have been receiving emails on a regular basis from Fever something that i did not opt in for. I have asked to be taken off the mailing list especially considering I don’t even have the app anymore!!! And i have asked for my data to be erased. I guess we’ll see if they can manage that although if my experience with them is anything to go by i guess I’ll be ignored to have to report them again!",Theives and terrible customer service,2019-03-03 20:42:26,1,ScarletBex13,GB

We then later discovered that the even was further down the street at a different event and was actually a PRIVATE PARTY! I will be complaining and I will be getting my money back for time and effort gone into travelling to the event in the first place! I hate to give it even 1 star but I actually don't have a choice. The app should be operated a lot better. Reminds me of groupons early days.

By way of an update: I was fortunate enough to purchase tickets through PayPal and have since opened a dispute. Today is the last day of the dispute and the seller or the owner of the app has not made any contact either directly or via PayPal to resolve the issue. This app is a fraud!

Kind regards,  Fever Team', 'modified': '2019-06-19T10:47:44Z'}","It’s a real shame as there are some fantastic deals through this App but you cannot pay! On several occasions I have attempted to purchase items to be greeted with ‘Oops, there has been an error’ when trying to pay. The latest (June 15 2019) has resulted in three live chats with advice to ensure I have the right App version, log in and log out, change my payment method...and finally try through the website...goes against the point of having an App!!!!!! And then I cannot pay through the website either! Frustrating. I would rather be advised that the payment system is not working properly but to continually put the issue in the customer as the issue provides frustrating experience. Sort it out!",Appalling!,2019-06-15 10:54:26,1,App Queenie,GB
