0,"I am one happy customer due to the great service I received with getting my voucher issues sorted.
I bought my tickets last year not realising I had used a different email to log on to purchase them. As a consequence I didn’t read the email notification about concert to be cancelled due to Covid. I contacted fever team who assisted me redeem my vouchers. I made another mistake with bookings and mentioned it to Paula@fever who was assisting me not expecting anything. I was pleasantly surprised when told they’d look into it straightaway and resolved that issue as well! I now am able to purchase tickets using the vouchers to a concert of my choice. 
Thank you very much fever team.

1,"Couldn’t recommend this app more highly. In addition to the great discount program and ease of purchasing tickets, the customer service is excellent. I’ve used great apps before in relation to content, but the customer service when you need assistance was shocking and stopped using them.

2,"It’s been the worst experience I ever had with an events app.

I first bought two tickets to go to a candlelight concert. The concert was canceled due to rain and so the event people told us, they changed the date of our tickets and, in the case that we couldn’t attend that day, to contact fever up to reschedule. Unfortunately we couldn’t attend to the new date so I contacted fever up several times to get my tickets rescheduled as there was another event later on, after two weeks of trying to reach out to them, didn’t get an answer and lost the opportunity to attend the concert as they replied to me when there were no dates available anymore. When I asked for a refund they just gave me a voucher to use in another event.

After a while, I saw another event in which I wasn't too  interested but I had to use the voucher, right? So I went in and try to purchase two tickets with the voucher. I had so many errors in the app and they ended up charging me $135 in my bank card and only use a bit of the voucher!! SO FRUSTRATING 
Now they don’t want to refund me the $135. So they’re basically stealing from me. Terrible.

Fever up- is that how you make money? Charging users mistakenly and making them use that money again in your terrible app?

This will obviously be raised with consumer affairs.",alulada,2021-04-15 20:33:34,1,Worst app and customer service ever,"{'id': 22303965, 'body': 'Hello, we are sorry that you feel that way.

3,"I booked tickets to ""Candlelight Open Air: Chopin’s Best Works"" for myself and my partner. I was drawn in by the advertised candle lit park overlooking the river, and bought the best tickets I could seated closest to the water (as detailed on the seating plan). I booked the event in time with sunset in view of the setting. I have never before been more disappointed in my life when we arrived at the venue. The candle lit park overlooking the water had been replaced by what looked like didgy school hall you would be embarrassed to see your kids music recital in. 

Upon arrival the staff didn't know where to direct us after receiving our tickets, we were eventually shown to a spare row of uncomfortable plastic chairs that protested with loud screeches at the slightest of movement. 

The performance dragged on for an uninspiring hour punctuated only by the extremely regular screeches of the cheap decor, the hacking sound of the ancient aircondition looming over the already low ceilings like some sort of evil spirit, and regular unsilenced phone calls and covid sounding dry coughs.

I have never been more embarrassed to have invited someone to such a garbage event. I wouldn’t recommend this app or their events",Isaac LeM,2021-02-15 14:43:04,1,Very disappointing experience,"{'id': 21574301, 'body': 'Hello Isaac.

5,I had my tickets automatically change to 8.30 from the 6.30 tickets I purchased without checking if this was ok. As soon as I and my friends realised the day before they were able to change theirs back however the agent Audra said it was impossible and indicated I needed to attend that time as there were no more times available. She did indicate I could attend another fever event for the same price however she didn’t appear to understand that people purchase tickets for things they would like to see. No offer of refund at all.

6,"Could not change the date, despite falling ill and then could not get a refund for the event. It was within 48h, but the event is a continuous 3 month nightly thing that you walk into (it’s a light show in a park, not like I was taking up a seat in a concert or something) so to change the date should not have been a problem.
They should look into having a different cancellation/refund service based on the type of event. This was very disappointing and felt very cold and corporate as a response.

54,"They change the concert time and date without give you a notice, 
My booking is on 16/12 /7: 30 pm, and they secretly change my tickets from the app to 20/12 4:30pm on 15/12( a day before the concert).Without give us any notice.

When we asking the refund from them ,and ask if they can refund me to another of my account(because after I book the tickets with them, my card details and money be stolen, so I did cancel this card) they refused my request , and I told them I will write my reviews on their Facebook page but they just told me “ do whatever you want “ and close my call.

When I check the page I found out so many people have the same bad situation like me, they wrote the bad reviews to show the people how they cheat us but after 1 hour, fever delete all the reviews from their Facebook page!!

and I notice someone write here said be careful with your bank details on this app, it’s true!!!!!! because after I book my tickets with them ,someone stole my card details and my money from my account!!!!!!

Guys please please be careful and don’t book with them!!! I am sure this company can not be trust!!!",moody172,2020-12-18 09:26:20,1,Guys please be careful !!!!!!!!!!!! Don’t book with them!!!!,,False,AU
