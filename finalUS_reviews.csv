I tried to get a refund for the experience but they said they do not do refunds and I can get a voucher instead. So whatever I did. The event is now showing that it has ended and the show wasn’t even supposed to happen until March. I have been trying to reach out to these people to get a voucher to use on something else and they have been of no help. I also have another voucher that I can only use for the Star Wars experience.

That’s very important (because I’m pretty sure most of the events either don’t actually exist or they are put together very poorly). 
Second, my story and experience with fever is much the same as those who have given a similar rating. I bought tickets for two events MONTHS in advance. The week before the first one (the candlelight concert) I noticed that the dates on our tickets had changed to a later date. When I tried the “chat live” option, I got a message saying they were busy and then another saying to email my email to them so they could get back to me later. I asked for either the date on our tickets to be changed back to when we had originally booked or for a refund. When someone eventually got back to me, I was told they had to unexpectedly “postpone” the event. I asked for a refund of the tickets for that event as well as the Van Gogh event. I was told I would be receiving a refund and I’m waiting patiently for that to occur. 
Please look this app up on the Better Business Bureau, those reports say a lot of the same things. This app is a scam and I have no idea how it has such a high rating. It’s the Fyre festival all over again.",US

Original review: Fever has horrible customer service and there is no phone number to contact anyone. We had a death in the family and wanted to reschedule our tickets to an event that evening and Israel the live chat agent was very rude to me after I explained the situation. We weren’t asking for a refund, just a reschedule. I asked to speak with a supervisor or manager and he said that was not possible. He said “I’m not going to bend rules for you or anyone else. If you had contacted us 24 hours in advance we may have been able to help you. No company in world would give you refund the same day.” And then he disconnected the chat before I could respond. Again, we didn’t want a refund, just a reschedule. Horrible way to treat someone who is grieving. Never again!",US

When I viewed my most recent purchase it said there was only one ticket. I was pretty upset because it was a purchase for my son the next day and I was worried that there would not be tickets left this late. I was confident that I had made a purchase of three but I continued to refresh the app and it continued to display only one. I even showed it to my  I then purchased two additional tickets so our family could attend the planned event. Minutes later I returned to the app and it now stated 3 tickets on the original purchase and 2 on the second purchase. I reached out to the customer service line which responded that they do not issue refunds. To me this is a no brainer in customer service. If a customer is telling you the app you developed and regulate had an error which resulted in additional purchases the company should issue a refund. In addition this also to me seems like fraud. If I tell the user they only have one ticket they'll buy more and that increases my sales. Overall I'm not returning to this app, if this is how they operate fraudulently.

I purchased two tickets through fever which I thought was for the whole exhibit but turns out I spent 50 dollars for only garden passes. Very misleading. 

On the day of the event it was total down pour. The weather was awful for an outdoor art exhibit. I contacted NYBG who told me to contact fever since they couldn’t refund me. Fever did nothing to help me. They didn’t offer a refund, didn’t offer a voucher just took my 50 dollars despite being misleading, doesn’t explain their ticketing policy or anything. They were just like lols sorry we only give vouchers 48 hours before the event. They say whatever they can to blow you off and take your money.

No biggie - I bought for the third day while a big red sign flashed at me saying “LESS THAN TEN TICKETS LEFT. BUY NOW” Gross marketing tactic to get people to buy without thinking. Then, if you read the notice fully, it says less than ten tickets left “at their best price.” I was also able to buy at least 12 tickets at their “best price” that supposedly only had 10 left.

WRONG TIME! This was not my mistake neither I have changed my mind. It was purely an app malfunction BUT the only answer I got is that they have no-refund policy.

 Closer to the new dates the event was canceled stating that we would be given vouchers for the same event. However, no new dates were posted. Since no new dates were posted I contacted costumer service requesting a refund (my tickets were $140) since the event had no new dates.

After multiple back and forth emails , fever refuses to offer a refund and insists on providing vouchers. I was told the event I initially purchased tickets for is no longer offered and I was told to check the fever app regularly FOR THE NEXT NINE MONTHS just to see if they make new dates available. How does that make any sense? If the original event is not being offered we should be given refunds. Their customer service is poor and their practices are unfair and deceptive.

On occasion, you are logged out then need codes to access your tickets. Not user friendly. Where’s the ‘face ID’ option to avoid this mess? I’ve tried FEVER for 2 events. The first event cancelled twice with poor communication from FEVER. The 2nd event (Love Actually Live), I believed we had purchased 2 specific (numbered) seats in a premium seating area only to find they were not specific seat locations, and we would be assigned seats by the ‘house manager’. If I’d gone directly to the venue website, I would have been able to select precise seat locations and for less money in the ‘premium zone’. I have no clue where in ‘zone A - premium viewing’ we are sitting for the show. And the terms for seating locations don’t match the terms at the venue.

Also, on the Van Gogh exhibit *website* (not the app), choosing a date and time is easy (one can clearly see which dates & times still have availability). On the app, however, to find out if there is still availability, one has to scroll through the dates, then scroll through the times, and then scroll through the different ways to pay.

I attended one of their self-hosted and run Dining in the Dark events - an event they “copied” from real Dark Dining experiences, and completely, utterly botched.

Suffice to say, the experience was terrible across the board - bad and insufficient food, absurdly overpriced, lackluster table service, and additional price gouging at every opportunity. Worst of all, they made a mockery of the tradition - Dark Dining experiences are a very special tradition in the blind community, and Fever cut every possible corner in staging this sham, in a way that would’ve been impossible to know before paying up front.

Of course I reached out to them in an attempt to rectify afterwards: wrote a review, responded to an automated customer service reach out, and even proactively wrote customer experience again weeks after the event.
What did I get for all my troubles? A response that seemed like a joke - many un-returned emails later, a rep basically pretended to “thank” me for my review and ended with a smiley face, not once even acknowledging or remotely apologizing for the terrible experience, or seeking to rectify the situation.

Not wanting to be inundated with marketing emails, I downloaded the App using a “hidden” Apple email address.  It first asks you to “choose a city.”  When I begin typing “San Antonio,” it immediately tells me my city isn’t listed.  It’s listed alright…it just makes you go through all the cities to find the one you’re looking for!

Since I didn’t sign up using the same email address I used to purchase the tickets, the app can’t “connect” to my previous purchase. There doesn’t seem to be a way to enter my confirmation number as an alternative.

When I finally break down and try to update my email address…only to now get a message saying “ERROR SETTING THE USER DATA.”

I looked up their legal documents and called their Data Protection Officer number legally required to be posted. Not only is the company directory empty, but all their mailboxes are ""full"".
I had AmEx file a fraud complaint on my behalf. AmEx refunded me PROMPTLY b/c they also found a bunch of shady things.
Not satisfied, I then sent their CMO, CEO and VP if CS in-mails and emails. NO REPLY.
I noticed a former employee of my Large Tech Company now worker there and sent HIM a ""strongly worded email"". The response was rude and also shady.
I don't know if they INTENDED to defraud people but they are. And they are doing so against data Protection laws and regulations.

I can order a family pack with discounted tix for the 2 kids, so I selected that for a date and time I wanted and then added 3 adult tickets....I was charged for 7 adults.

I actually work in live events and that’s not really a thing at the moment) anyways, I’m told that I have been issued vouchers for three free identical tickets at a later date. However when I went to get tickets for the new date with the vouchers they supplied my account Fever wanted to charge me an addition $16. That’s weird but whatever, I get on the live chat for assistance. The guy on there tells me I have received full credit and there’s nothing he can do. I tell him it’s not a full credit by definition if I’m being charged. He says that prices have changed and tough luck, I was given all of my money back in full as fiver credit. But that’s not a full ticket credit—that’s taking my $112 US dollars and exchanging it into 112 “Fever bucks”. Hardly an equal value. First they cancelled my tickets and then want to charge me more money to reschedule. I was even exchanging a Sunday for a Sunday. It feels like a scam, so I asked for a regular refund and then was told that tickets purchased on Fever are non-refundable and non-exchangeable and that someone might contact me about it later. Well, I just got the response email they said to look out for: an automatically generated email that said they won’t refund me at all, it’s not their policy. Am I being petty over the difference of $16? Perhaps. I just want to see dinosaurs with my family for the same price that was literally bought and paid for months ago. I’m not certain but this feels borderline illegal and at this point it’s more of a principle thing.

I took off work and we drove two hours to the theater only to be turned away because, starting that day, the theater was requiring proof of vaccination and/or a recent COVID test.  We spent another couple of hours looking for a pharmacy which would do a rapid test since one of us didn't have a copy of their card along.  At 1:00 p.m.we both received an email message from Fever informing us of the new requirement.  I reached out to Fever to get a refund on the tickets the next day.  First I was told I couldn't because I transferred both tickets I purchased to my friend.  Not true, I only transferred one but paid for both on my credit card.  Then I was told Fever doesn't issue refunds, but I would only be given a voucher towards another date and time for this event or another event.  They failed to inform us of this change in policy prior to the date and time of our tickets. This wasn't a random last minute policy change by the theater.  It was due to a recent requirement by the City of Philadelphia.  Had we lived in the Phila. area we may have been aware of it.

I bought 2 tickets to the candlelight dinner with a classical artist at Yamashiro for $130. The reservation included a free wine/beer, premium appetizer, and of course, watching the artist. This did not include entrees. I normally would not spend so much BUT I figured, my boyfriend & I would enjoy being sat in the beautiful garden while enjoying peaceful classical live music. I got an email less than 24 hrs before saying that because there were only 2 of us in my party, we were going to be moved to an outside patio and have a direct view to a TV (A TV!!!!) which would display the artist. Why would I pay $130 for a patio and tv experience... again, not including actual dinner. I was upset because I felt the description was extremely deceptive. I immediately tried getting in contact with them. I was put on hold for an hour and even then, I was not able to get in contact with a single representative. I emailed multiple times and they claimed that they were “experiencing high volumes of emails”— I would only get automated responses. Finally, I was able to get in contact with someone via the chat through the app. I expressed my concerns and “Nestor” told me that he would send my request up to a different department because they didn’t handle cases like mine. So he told me that they would be in contact with me through email shortly. I asked if I could speak with the department directly and he told me that the department did not have a phone number.

I fell prey to the confusing advertising and misleading nature of Fever's sales tactics to sell tickets for ""Van Gogh: The Immersive Experience."" I had intended to buy tickets for ""Immersive Van Gogh"" and due to the confusing nature of these two events and Fever's heavy advertising (putting it on sale the same day as the other event! both taking place this summer in New York and both at unnamed locations and both with essentially the same name!) - I unwittingly purchased two adult tickets and one child ticket thinking it was for the other event. The ""Immersive Van Gogh"" exhibit had been depicted on a television show and that was the one I thought I was buying tickets for. How could there possibly be two?! I thought. When I contacted Fever asking for a refund because I was essentially duped into buying tickets for the wrong event, I was told no refunds allowed. (Due to their confusing app, I also accidentally purchased 3 children's tickets -- they did refund that.)

But they refused to return my money for the two adults/one child tickets. I have submitted these transactions as disputes on PayPal, but Fever says it’s keeping my money.

Arriving early at the event, I was told by Hornblower staff, the ship it was supposed to be on, that there was no such event or cruise ship leaving from the pier for it. I noticed other people trying to attend the event, with just as much confusion on their faces when they realized there was no boat prepared. 

I contacted Fever that day, asking what happened, why I never received an event cancellation email and for a refund. I was only told, “We’ll message our other department and investigate why this happened.” I called again three days later, still the same reply. I called a week later from the event, and after chatting with them about an obviously fake event, I’m told my request for a refund would take 10+ days. What refund takes 10+ days?! Why would it also take so long for them to investigate their own event? I ask for an email confirmation of the refund statement and am told it will come in five minutes. It never came. I call again an hour later, only to be told the same information, and when I ask for the name of the person I’m speaking with, I’m given an obviously fake name. 

This has been a hugely upsetting experience. I’ve never dealt with a fake event app, and I’m sorry I ever used this app. I wasted a $100 on a seemingly legit app. Please don’t make the same mistakes I did.

I agree with the previous customer review. Cool concept and some good events, a few that I attended. However customer service is a sham.

As it says there are no refunds EVEN when they advertise a false event!

Seven days ago I bought tickets for $72 event. When I got there, there was No event. The venue was CLOSED. I double checked the time on the tickets which was correct. I called the venue which didn't pick up because they were closed. Try to call them, didn't work, and no email. So I used their chat system, in which the person vaguely said they look into it. Two days later when their charge cleared I asked again when they would take care of it and was met with a  rude response, saying the matter takes time.  

7 day later no change in my bank account, no outreach, even sent a chat message today which was ignored.

Their customer service needs to be rechecked and their wording needs to be honored. I feel as a customer, I have been very misled and scammed.

I have never been so misled or treated with such disrespect by any venue/event organizer/company. I have never gone to purchase tickets for an event where their refund policy is not displayed while doing the purchasing, not buried deep in a very misleading ‘Terms of Use’.

Also if you buy a VIP ticket and change to a regular ticket THEY KEEP THE DIFFERENCE 😳. In my case I would lose 150.00 bucks. So now I am trying to get a voucher to rebook VIP Tickets. SUPER FRUSTRATING!",US

This business is borderline a scam,"Bought four tickets to an event to then learn I needed to repurchase these tickets with a code Fever provided at the organizers website. I paid for tickets + booking fee to find myself having to repeat the process again.
When I try to use the codes to repurchase, the codes do not work. I reach out to an email (email?! second red flag)
They come back to me with a voucher that I can use for same/another event but I have to pay booking fees again. C’mon. That is ridiculous.
This service is three millennials scamming people from a NY apartment with a crappy customer service process.
Avoid this app, go to the organizers site and buy the tickets you want.

Afterwards, I received the confirmation email with the Ticket ID number listed, along with instructions on how to get the tickets, with a link provided that re-directs you to the Eventbrite site. The instructions further states, there’s a promo code to use on Eventbrite. You need to select the same tickets you purchased from Fever, and the total should be $0 during the purchase process on Eventbrite. This is not the case. 

I’ve emailed Fever 3 times. They sent the same confirmation email I received after purchasing the tickets stating the Promo Code and Ticket ID  number is listed. You can’t download the tickets from the Fever App. It has the same instructions on listed on it, like the email confirmation. 

Who’s sending the emails out?? I don’t know if the email is auto generated or what but clearly there wasn’t a Promo Code, just the Ticket ID number like before.  

I’m currently waiting to hear back from someone on the Fever team regarding the code, in order for me to get the $140 tickets I paid for.
